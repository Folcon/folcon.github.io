					<p>They are a space of doing allowing their makers to offer the player ownership of the experience as well as a seat at the table.</p>

					<p>One of the ways I look at imagination separate from things that are more freeform, like improv or roleplaying is generators.</p>

					<p>I'm a voracious reader.</p>
					<p>Growing up you could always find me nose deep in a book, trying to breathe in the ideas.</p>
					<p>As a result I've been fascinated by what thoughts can be wrangled together with simple words.</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p>Simple ones like...</p>
					<p class="fragment"><em>Maps don't just have outside edges. They have inside edges. Holes</em></p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p>Or evoke passion...</p>
					<p class="fragment"><em>All I want, is the taste that your lips allow</em></p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<p>Or even clarity through confusion...</p>
					<p class="fragment"><em>The stars hung in the sky like bricks don't.</em></p>

					<p>I collect quotes for this reason.</p>
					<blockquote class="fragment">
						&ldquo;The best moments in reading are when you come across something

						And it is as if a hand has come out and taken yours.&rdquo;

				<section data-background="#dddddd" data-auto-animate>
					<p>I collect quotes for this reason.</p>
					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;Most books didn't say "And then they refused to give up, no matter how sensible

						but a great deal of history made a lot more sense that way.&rdquo;
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#dddddd" data-auto-animate>
					<p>I collect quotes for this reason.</p>
					<blockquote>
						&ldquo;Like, I've been making instant Ramen for years. And for years,

						Everything. And then Tenten-chan started to do it for me, and now it...

						But it tastes more meaningful.&rdquo;
