    <h3 id="well-sort-of">Well sort of</h3><h4 id="if-you-squint-really-hard">If you squint really hard</h4><p>Two weeks ago we were poking around <a href="https://folcon.github.io/post/fulcro-basics/2020-05-12-Fulcro-via-re-frame/">Fulcro with the frontend</a>, now let's check it out on the "backend", with our star performer, <a href="https://wilkerlucio.github.io/pathom/v2">Pathom</a>.</p><p>You've probably noticed that I've written backend in air-quotes, well I thought about it a lot, well ok a little bit and decided that I wanted to stick to introducing as few things as possible, so in that vein, we're going to use a pretty nifty feature that pathom has, you can run it on the client üòÅ...</p><p>Now, this has some cool implications, you can use pathom to manage talking to all kinds of other external api's for you via rest interfaces or graph api's or err SOAP (here be dragons), but we're not going to do any of that =)...</p><p>We're just going to pretend that our pathom parser can see some db and talk to it...</p><h3 id="lets-get-started">Let's get started</h3><p>Here's an <a href="https://github.com/Folcon/fulcro-starter/tree/695ce744684ec3263ecd97c3bda995478cee665e">updated github repo</a> for you to follow along with the code =)...</p><p>We're working with some new concept, so ultimately we should create a new <code>namespace</code>.</p><p>That btw tends to be a rule I like to follow to keep my programs easy to think about:</p><p><em>new concept = new namespace</em></p><p>Let's be really unimaginative and call it <code>pathom.cljs</code>:</p><pre><code>(ns fulcro-starter.pathom

</code></pre><p>We've gone back to our not so excellent example of <code>a-list-of-things</code> comprised of <code>a-thing</code>'s.</p><h3 id="pulling-data-out">Pulling data out</h3><p>Now how do we get something out of this?</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:a-list-of-things])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff", :fav-colour "red"}
                    {:a-thing "two stuff", :fav-colour "blue"}
                    {:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :fav-colour "green"}]}
</code></pre><p>Great! So know how to get out our <code>a-list-of-things</code>.</p><p>So now, what's going on here?</p><p>Well, what we have is a <code>parser</code> which <code>pathom</code> gives us that allows us to request data of a specific shape, and get back output of whatever data we can access in that shape.</p><p>In many ways, pathom fulfils a role similar to what graphql gives us if you're familiar with that, but with some differences, one of which we'll cover in a little bit.</p><p>Pathom does this by allowing you to define a <code>resolvers</code> using <code>defresolver</code>, any defined <code>resolvers</code> you give to pathom's <code>register</code> during its <code>parser</code> definition can be used by <code>pathom</code> to answer your <code>query</code>.</p><p>What's a <code>query</code>?</p><p>Well, the last <code>query</code> we used was:</p><pre><code>[:a-list-of-things]
</code></pre><p>In this query we asked pathom to give us something for <code>:a-list-of-things</code>, pathom replied with:</p><pre><code>{:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff", :fav-colour "red"}
                    {:a-thing "two stuff", :fav-colour "blue"}
                    {:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :fav-colour "green"}]}
</code></pre><p>Great!</p><p>But that's too much I'm getting back! I hear you say, I just wanted <code>:fav-colour</code>!</p><p>Well we can ask for that specifically:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:a-list-of-things [:fav-colour]}])
#_#_=&gt; {:a-list-of-things [{:fav-colour "red"} {:fav-colour "blue"} {:fav-colour "green"}]}
</code></pre><p>Now how does this all work?</p><p>Well, we've introduced a level of nesting because we wanted to provide some more detail, we've gone from this:</p><pre><code>[:a-list-of-things]
</code></pre><p>to this:</p><pre><code>[{:a-list-of-things [:fav-colour]}]
</code></pre><p>Pathom interprets a map that's provided in a query as a join and will try and use a resolver to satisfy whatever is queried within the context of that join.</p><p>Ok, well what happens if we ask for some information pathom doesn't know about?</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:a-list-of-things [:fav-colour :fav-shape]}])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:fav-colour "red", :fav-shape :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}
                    {:fav-colour "blue", :fav-shape :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}
                    {:fav-colour "green", :fav-shape :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}]}
</code></pre><p>As you can see pathom just tells us that it doesn't have that information using <code>:com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found</code>.</p><p>Now let's examine that resolver we started with in more detail:</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:a-list-of-things]}
  {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff" :fav-colour "red"}
                      {:a-thing "two stuff" :fav-colour "blue"}
                      {:a-thing "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff" :fav-colour "green"}]})
</code></pre><p>So we have a <code>::pc/output [:a-list-of-things]</code>, what's that all about?</p><p>Well let's play around with this resolver by altering slightly:</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:a-list-of-things]}
  {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff" :fav-colour "red"}
                      {:a-thing "two stuff" :fav-colour "blue"}
                      {:a-thing "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff" :fav-colour "green"}]
   :some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff" :fav-shape "square"}]})
</code></pre><p>Now before we go any further we should mention something, pathom caches whatever resolver definitions you've given it, so if you alter a definition like we're doing here, you must reload the namespace that contains the resolver, <em>as well as the one that contains the parser</em>! This is important, or you'll have old resolver definitions in your parser and won't be able to see any changes you've made to the resolver definitions.</p><p>This is less of a concern for us now as we're just working entirely in the <code>fulcro-starter.pathom</code> namespace, but if you start building a bigger application this sort of thing can trip you up! I know it's tripped me up a few times and I'm still trying to work out how to make <code>mount</code> et al work nicely with this.</p><p>So to continue from that little digression, let's reload the namespace <code>fulcro-starter.pathom</code>.</p><p>Now let's try our original query to check everything's working fine:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:a-list-of-things])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff", :fav-colour "red"}
                    {:a-thing "two stuff", :fav-colour "blue"}
                    {:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :fav-colour "green"}]}
</code></pre><p>Looks like nothing's changed on that front.</p><p>So let's try getting <code>:some-other-things</code>!</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:some-other-things])
#_#_=&gt; {:some-other-things :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}
</code></pre><p>Huh, that's interesting. So pathom can't find it.</p><p>Let's adjust our <code>::pc/output</code> in our resolver.</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:a-list-of-things :some-other-things]}
  {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "1 stuff" :fav-colour "red"}
                      {:a-thing "two stuff" :fav-colour "blue"}
                      {:a-thing "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff" :fav-colour "green"}]
   :some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff" :fav-shape "square"}]})
</code></pre><p>Now let's reload our namespace again and call our query.</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:some-other-things])
#_#_=&gt; {:some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}
</code></pre><p>Great! So we've learned something, pathom uses the <code>::pc/output</code> to work out what resolvers can resolve. So not having a key listed in our <code>::pc/output</code> can mean that even though we might be able to resolve it, pathom doesn't know we can.</p><h3 id="the-trace">The trace</h3><p>Now's probably a good time to look at what the <code>p/trace-plugin</code> does:</p><p>So what if we didn't know what either of those queries were doing? That's what tracing is for!</p><p>Let's pass in <code>:com.wsscode.pathom/trace</code> to our query:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:a-list-of-things :com.wsscode.pathom/trace])

</code></pre><p>Now, this may take you a little while to get used to reading and pathom does also offer <a href="https://github.com/wilkerlucio/pathom-viz">pathom-viz</a> which will provide a timeline visualisation as well.</p><p>So we can see that the <code>:duration</code> key shows the time taken in ms for that operation.</p><p>Let's take a look at the plan breakdown in more detail:</p><pre><code>[{:event "compute-plan",
  :duration 1,
  :start 1,
  :plan (([:a-list-of-things
           fulcro-starter.pathom/a-list-of-things-resolver])),
  :provides #{:a-list-of-things}}
 {:event "call-resolver",

  :duration 0,
  :start 2,
  :key :a-list-of-things,
  :sym fulcro-starter.pathom/a-list-of-things-resolver}]
</code></pre><p>Pathom computes a plan, calls the resolver, gets a response and merges it back into the result.</p><p>Let's contrast this to a trace I took earlier when <code>:some-other-things</code> was not defined:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:some-other-things :com.wsscode.pathom/trace])

Pathom is telling is that to find <code>:a-list-of-things</code>, it needs to get <code>a-list-of-things-resolver</code> and <code>some-other-things-resolver</code>. What's happened?</p><p>Let's look at our resolver definitions:</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]

</code></pre><p>Well whoops! üò≥</p><p>Looks like we've made a mistake, our <code>::pc/output</code> for both the resolvers is wrong! They're declaring that they can provide more information that they can.</p><p>Let's fix that:</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]

</code></pre><p>Now looking at the plan computed we can see that only <code>a-list-of-things-resolver</code> is called.</p><p>Let's unpack a little what's going on here.</p><p>The trace above can broadly be broken down into these steps:</p><ol><li>what does <code>:a-list-of-things</code> want?</li><li>ok, it needs three items, what are they?</li><li>so for the first item it needs <code>:a-thing</code> and <code>:fav-colour</code>, we've got <code>:a-thing</code>, how do we find out <code>:fav-colour</code>?</li><li>then do 3. for the second and third item.</li></ol><p>While it goes it merges in the data that it collects. Try and scan the plan above and see if you can spot where it's doing all the steps I've mentioned.</p><p>Ok, I think we've covered traces in a reasonable amount of detail, don't hesitate to reach for them if you find yourself wanting to understand what pathom's doing!</p><h3 id="what-about-getting-something">What about getting something?</h3><p>All this time we've discussed getting a predefined thing, but what happens when we know what we want?</p><p>Well we need to join against a specified attribute like so:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{[:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff"] [:a-thing :fav-colour]}])
#_#_=&gt; {[:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff"] {:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :fav-colour "green"}}
</code></pre><p>That was pretty straightforward huh? =)...</p><h3 id="we-dont-have-a-root">We don't have a root</h3><p>Let's discuss one difference between graphql and pathom.</p><p>pathom doesn't have a notion of a root. That's because pathom views the data it accesses as a graph, so you can do things like this:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:a-list-of-things [:some-other-things]}])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}
                    {:some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}
                    {:some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}]}
</code></pre><p>This must look really weird right? I mean what's going on?</p><p>Well perhaps this might shed some light on the matter:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:a-list-of-things [:a-thing :some-other-things]}])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}
                    {:a-thing "1 stuff", :some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}
                    {:a-thing "two stuff", :some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff", :fav-shape "square"}]}]}
</code></pre><p>That's right, we're just telling pathom to find us <code>:a-list-of-things</code> and for every entry also get us <code>:some-other-things</code>.</p><p>So how does this work?</p><p>Well if you look at <code>a-thing-resolver</code> vs <code>a-list-of-things-resolver</code> and <code>some-other-things-resolver</code>, you'll see a clear difference, spotted it?</p><p><code>a-thing-resolver</code> defines a <code>::pc/input</code> while the other two do not.</p><p>That's a big difference, that means <code>a-list-of-things-resolver</code> and <code>some-other-things-resolver</code> can be called anywhere within your query and they'll return their results.</p><p>Also, note that <code>::pc/input</code> defines a set! This is important!</p><p>Now, why is this useful? Sometimes you might want to be able to add some specific structure deep inside your query, the canonical example is to create a <code>timestamp-resolver</code>:</p><pre><code>(pc/defresolver timestamp-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:timestamp]}
  {:timestamp (.now js/Date)})
</code></pre><p>Just add the above resolver to <code>all-resolvers</code> reload the namespace and now if you needed to you can get the timestamp within a query, you can!</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:a-list-of-things [:a-thing {:some-other-things [:fav-shape :timestamp]}]}])
#_#_=&gt;
{:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :some-other-things [{:fav-shape "square", :timestamp 1590525422451}]}
                    {:a-thing "1 stuff", :some-other-things [{:fav-shape "square", :timestamp 1590525422451}]}
                    {:a-thing "two stuff", :some-other-things [{:fav-shape "square", :timestamp 1590525422451}]}]}
</code></pre><h3 id="the-placeholder-prefix">The Placeholder prefix</h3><p>Now what's this part all about?</p><pre><code>::p/placeholder-prefixes #{"&gt;"}
</code></pre><p>Well that's a nifty feature of pathom =)...</p><p>Let's say for some reason we decided that we wanted to have our keys prefixed by <code>:something</code>.</p><p>Maybe our client needed it in that structure, or you want to pull data from multiple api's and need to artificially add one level of nesting.</p><p>Well let's try it:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:something [:a-list-of-things]}])
#_#_=&gt; {:something :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}
</code></pre><p>Uh oh, pathom doesn't know what to do with that.</p><p>Enter <code>&gt;</code> the placeholder prefix.</p><p>By using it as a namespace pathom knows that the key you're providing is just there to artifically add a level of nesting:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:&gt;/something [:a-list-of-things]}])
#_#_=&gt; {:&gt;/something {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff"} {:a-thing "1 stuff"} {:a-thing "two stuff"}]}}
</code></pre><p>One particularly nice use for it that I've found is that it allows you to create two views at the same level:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{:&gt;/list [:a-list-of-things]}
            {:&gt;/some [:some-other-things]}])
#_#_=&gt;
{:&gt;/list {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff"} {:a-thing "1 stuff"} {:a-thing "two stuff"}]},
 :&gt;/some {:some-other-things [{:a-thing "other stuff"}]}}
</code></pre><h3 id="mutations">Mutations</h3><p>We've not discussed mutations at all, so let's go over that =)...</p><p>Let's update our code to allow us to call mutations:</p><pre><code>(ns fulcro-starter.pathom
  (:require [com.wsscode.pathom.core :as p]
            [com.wsscode.pathom.connect :as pc]))

...

(pc/defresolver timestamp-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:timestamp]}
  {:timestamp (.now js/Date)})

(pc/defmutation add-thing [_ {:keys [a-thing] :as params}]
  {::pc/params [:a-thing]}
  (println :a-thing a-thing)
  {:a-thing a-thing})


(def all-resolvers
  [a-thing-resolver a-list-of-things-resolver some-other-things-resolver timestamp-resolver add-thing])

(def parser
  (p/parser
    {...
     ::p/mutate pc/mutate
     ...))
</code></pre><p>So our mutation to start with doesn't mutate anything, but let's build it up =)...</p><p>So we reload our namespace and call:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [`(add-thing {:a-thing "four stuff"})])
:a-thing four stuff
#_#_=&gt; {fulcro-starter.pathom/add-thing {:a-thing "four stuff"}}
</code></pre><p>Ok, so that's interesting, pathom returns a symbol of the mutation name as the key and then returns our mutation result, we'll cover why it does that in a little bit, but it's nice to note.</p><p>Now, since we're running a mutation we need to mutate something, so let's change some of our definitions:</p><pre><code>(def a-things-data
  (atom {"1 stuff" {:a-thing "1 stuff" :fav-colour "red"}
         "two stuff" {:a-thing "two stuff" :fav-colour "blue"}
         "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff" {:a-thing "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff" :fav-colour "green"}
         "other stuff" {:a-thing "other stuff" :fav-shape "square"}}))

(def a-list-of-things-data
  (atom #{"1 stuff"
          "two stuff"
          "\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5\uD83D\uDCA5 stuff"}))

(def some-other-things-data
  (atom #{"other stuff"}))

(pc/defresolver a-thing-resolver [_ params]
  {::pc/input #{:a-thing}
   ::pc/output [:a-thing :fav-colour :fav-shape]}
  (get @a-things-data (:a-thing params)))

(pc/defresolver a-list-of-things-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:a-list-of-things]}
  {:a-list-of-things (mapv (fn [id] {:a-thing id}) @a-list-of-things-data)})

(pc/defresolver some-other-things-resolver [_ _]
  {::pc/output [:some-other-things]}
  {:some-other-things (mapv (fn [id] {:a-thing id}) @some-other-things-data)})
</code></pre><p>Now we can <code>swap!</code> these definitions!</p><p>So let's modify our mutation to take advantage of this:</p><pre><code>(pc/defmutation add-thing [_ {:keys [a-thing] :as params}]
  {::pc/params [:a-thing]}
  (println :a-thing a-thing)
  (swap! a-things-data assoc a-thing params)
  (swap! a-list-of-things-data conj a-thing)
  {:a-thing a-thing})
</code></pre><p>Now let's reload our namespace ;)...</p><pre><code>(parser {} [`(add-thing {:a-thing "four stuff"})])
:a-thing four stuff
#_#_=&gt; {fulcro-starter.pathom/add-thing {:a-thing "four stuff"}}
</code></pre><p>Looks good, did it change?</p><pre><code>(parser {} [:a-list-of-things])
#_#_=&gt; {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff"} {:a-thing "1 stuff"} {:a-thing "two stuff"} {:a-thing "four stuff"}]}
</code></pre><p>Whoop! üéâ</p><p>Now, why was I so interested earlier in what pathom returned from the mutation?</p><p>Well because you can do this:</p><pre><code>(parser {} [{`(add-thing {:a-thing "four stuff"})
               [{:a-list-of-things [:a-thing :fav-colour]}]}])
:a-thing four stuff
=&gt;
{fulcro-starter.pathom/add-thing {:a-list-of-things [{:a-thing "üí•üí•üí• stuff", :fav-colour "green"}
                                                     {:a-thing "1 stuff", :fav-colour "red"}
                                                     {:a-thing "two stuff", :fav-colour "blue"}
                                                     {:a-thing "four stuff",
                                                      :fav-colour :com.wsscode.pathom.core/not-found}]}}
</code></pre><p>So you if your mutation gives back a valid id-like thing you can chain your mutation into a query!</p><p>I think I've given you a reasonable overview of what the more server-side part of fulcro is like, but the best part is pathom's a library! You don't have to use it with fulcro =)... Just add it to a project when you want a way of querying complex data via a graphql-like api.</p>
