					<p>Games have given me dilemmas that other art just haven't offered, they've made me feel loss, not a memory of it, actual loss as well as victory, accomplishment, guilt and regret.</p>
					<p>They are a space of doing, requiring participation, allowing their makers to offer the player a seat at the table and sharing ownership of the experience.</p>

				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Player Counts</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">This is a game for 4 to 10 players.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Just be careful on the larger numbers it can get chaotic and silly.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Aim for 5 or 6.</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Tokens</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Find a bunch of things that stack or can be used to form a pile. Stones, coins, or poker chips, biscuits if you're really hurting, can be used in a pinch, but beware of the temptation to eat your tokens.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">These are your tokens, they are the lifeblood of the game, so don't run out.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">You'll need at least 10 per player.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Deal out 5 tokens to each player and place the rest to the side.</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Tone and Setting</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">For the first game I'd play things relatively light in tone.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Let's briefly touch on setting, ie what world the game exists in.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For the first few games, draw inspiration from films such as: The Princess Bride, Indiana Jones or the Mummy Films.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Feel free in subsequent games to change up the setting.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">It may be interesting to set things in space, like in Star Wars or Firefly, or a zombie film or anywhere else!</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Just make sure everyone is clear what tone you're aiming for, as well as what the setting everyone inhabits looks and feels like.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Media references help a lot here.</p>

					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Characters</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Now we're going to create characters for each of you to play as.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For the first game make them larger than life and be willing to make them a little silly. It will mesh well with the light tone.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">We're going to use a <strong>persona deck</strong> to create a rough sketch of your character.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Then we will use <strong>qualities dice</strong> rolls to pick larger than life <em>qualities</em> that grant them a seat at this table.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="color: #1b91ff;">Let's start!</p>
				</section>

				
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Persona Cards</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Now everyone draw three cards from the <strong>persona deck</strong>, pick at least two to be your <em>persona</em> which you will adopt for this game.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For example, if you end up picking <em>Noble</em>, <em>Beggar</em> and something else, maybe you decide to play a down on their luck royalty, or a leader of beggars, or perhaps even a royal posing as an itinerant beggar, investigating their kingdom.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="color: #1b91ff;">Choose!</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Qualities Roll</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Now, let's talk about the <strong>qualities dice</strong>.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">This will give your character some larger than life qualities.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now, roll the <strong>qualities dice</strong> 3 times and make note of what you get.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">These will always be one of <em>The Fastest</em>, <em>The Strongest</em>, <em>The Smartest</em>, <em>The Sharpest</em>, <em>The Boldest</em> and <em>The Slyest</em>.</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Select Qualities</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Now, choose at most two of your qualities rolls.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">If you choose one, unless someone else chooses the same quality as you once, you are unequivocally the greatest at that quality, you are <em>The Fastest</em> for example.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">However, if anyone else chooses the same quality as you once, they are your chief rival for that title. Treat them accordingly.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">If you selected two, you are renowned for those two qualities the world over instead.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For example, there can only be one who is <em>The Fastest</em>, but there may be many who are <em>Fast</em>.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Just to be super clear, as I'm worried this may be confusing, I've done an example on the next slide.</p>
				</section>
				

				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Select Qualities</small>
					<table style="font-size: small;">
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Alice Rolls</td>
								<td><em>The Strongest</em></td>
								<td><em>The Smartest</em></td>
								<td><em>The Strongest</em></td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bob Rolls</td>
								<td><em>The Boldest</em></td>
								<td><em>The Strongest</em></td>

							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Claire Rolls</td>
								<td><em>The Strongest</em></td>
								<td><em>The Smartest</em></td>
								<td><em>The Fastest</em></td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p style="font-size: large;">Alice chooses one roll, to be the strongest. Note even through she's rolled it twice she can't select it twice.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Claire chooses one roll, to also be the strongest. Alice and Claire and <em>Stronger</em> than all others and have a rivalry to become the <em>The Strongest</em>.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Their players may choose to tell stories that feature each other competing, or <em>complications</em> could arise that natually put them in conflict.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Bob selects two rolls, the strongest and the slyest. His character will be <em>Sly</em> and <em>Strong</em></p>
					<p style="font-size: large;">However if Bob comes into situations where he is in conflict with either Alice or Claire in matters of Strength, either of them will overcome him.</p>
				</section>

					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Qualities Descriptions</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Fastest</em>, you could simply run very quickly, but perhaps your fingers dance rings around a piano, or no one can draw their gun faster.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Strongest</em>, you kick like a mule, or can lift the largest weights, or wrestle a bear without breaking into a sweat.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Smartest</em>, you can watch two people fighting and find weaknesses that others have missed. Figure out how to break into a fortress, or simply fix a malfunctioning machine.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Sharpest</em>, you pay careful attention to detail, never missing a thing, you can shoot a target from further away than anyone could believe. When given a project, you get things done, with everything running like clockwork. You can do fine detail work, like repairing a watch, or cracking a safe, or just never miss anyone sneaking up on you at night.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Boldest</em>, you're the best dressed, your presence fills any room if you will it. You could stand before a crowd of strangers start talking and before they know it, you've convinced them to take on an impossible task. With words tumbling from your lips, you can raise up or lay low any soul you wish.</p>
					<p style="font-size: large;"><em>The Slyest</em>, they better watch their pockets and pay careful attention to what you say, a lie and the truth sounds the same when you speak it. Spying and costume changes are routine in your eyes.</p>
					<p style="color: #1b91ff;">Choose your one or two!</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Creating a Character</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">You should hopefully have a <em>persona</em> as well as some <em>qualities</em>.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now think about them and focus these ideas down into a character. Don't worry about what you can and can't do, just clearly lay out your character in a sentence or two.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">It can be silly or serious, just make it vivid, memorable and larger than life.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Think about the characters in the reference media if that helps.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">You have your sentence(s)?</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Great, now everyone go around the table and introduce your characters!</p>
				</section>


				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Setting the Stage</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Now, here's where things get fun!</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Your character and the characters of the players before you are sitting in a drinking establishment of some description.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Figure out amongst yourselves what seems reasonable, or if you can't decide, it's a pub.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">You are playing those characters, you are allowed to do basically anything you could imagine those characters doing.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Treat it as an improv or roleplay experience. If you're familiar with those.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now you've got your characters and your tokens, that's all you need to start!</p>
				</section>

				
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Playing the Game</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">So here's how you play, you go around the table and ask a player to tell a story of their character's great exploits.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Maybe they discovered a marvellous creature in Australia, or decided to map the amazon river, or found a secret glade in the middle of an impenetrable forest undisturbed for centuries.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">If the player you're asking is quite experienced, feel free to choose the starting point as well.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For example, "Remember that time I found you playing the piano in a New York bar? You never did tell me how you escaped from those sky pirates who captured you. Why not regale us with that adventure!"</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now, give them a few seconds to think and launch into their daring tale!</p>
				</section>

				
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Complications</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">Once you feel they've hit their stride, or whenever you feel the desire, take a token from your stack and place it in front of them, adding with it a <em>complication</em> of some kind.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">For example, maybe if they were travelling by motor vehicle, it was attacked, or broke down.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Or maybe they were captured by a rival, or the person they were talking to was a spy.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">The only restriction is you are not allowed to actually state that the complication could kill them, as they're clearly here with us at this fine establishment.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">By the way, when you're just starting, don't give any player more than 3 tokens to deal with at a time, it can be very overwhelming.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now, that player has two choices, they can take a token from their pile, place it on top of yours and send it back. Netting you a new token.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Or they can take the token and add it to their pile, when they have successfully weaved your complication into their story.</p>
				</section>

				
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h4>How to Play</h2>
					<small>Continuing Play and Endings</small>
					<p style="font-size: large;">This state of affairs continues until the story is done. After which it's another players turn.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Always try to have a new story teller for the next tale.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Try to give everyone a chance to tell a story at least once, then if particular people want to have a few extra goes now and again in a round, let them, so long as it swings back around eventually.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Now, what happens if any player runs out of tokens?</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Well if it's the first time they've run out, their character is clearly losing steam at this point, so once more issue them three tokens from the set aside pile.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">If it's the second time they've run out and people still want to keep playing, quickly spin them up a new character and 5 more tokens. As the character they were playing has clearly run out of tales to tell.</p>
					<p class="fragment" style="font-size: large;">Once you've got the hang of it, this shouldn't take more than two minutes.</p>
